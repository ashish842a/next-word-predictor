## Introduction

The Next Word Predictor is a language model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It predicts the next word in a given sequence of words, making it useful for text completion, writing assistance, and more.

## Features

- Predict the next word in a sequence.
- Train the model on custom datasets.
- Save and load trained models.
- Evaluate model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashish842a/next-word-predictor.git
    \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd next-word-predictor
    \`\`\`


## Usage

1. To use the pre-trained model for next word prediction, run:
    \`\`\`bash
    python predict.py
    \`\`\`



## Model Training

The training script takes a text file as input and trains an LSTM model to predict the next word in a sequence. Customize hyperparameters and training configurations in the \`config.py\` file.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the model using the evaluation script:
    \`\`\`bash
    python next_word_predictor.py
    \`\`\`
